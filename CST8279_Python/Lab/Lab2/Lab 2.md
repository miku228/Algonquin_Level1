# Lab 2

The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with the debugging tools of Pycharm/VSCode. 

1. Download the 3 python example programs ex01.py, ex02.py, ex03.py
2. Create a new Pure Python Project in Pycharm.
3. In the location textbox, replace `PythonProject1` with `lab2` then uncheck the box "Create a main.py welcome script"
4. Use the `File|Open` menu to open the three downloaded programs.
5. Select `ex01.py` , right click and select Run to run the script. Observe the result in the Console window.
6. Repeat the same process for `ex02.py` and `ex03.py`.
7. Back on `ex01.py`, add a breakpoint line 6 of the code.
8. Click on the Debugger Tab Next to the Console Tab. Then click on the bug icon.
9. The execution of the code will stop line 6. Use the step over icon to step line by line in the code.
10. Repeat the same process on `ex02.py`. Put a breakpoint line 5.
11. Repeat the same process on `ex03.py`. Put a breakpoint line 3.
12. Learn how to stop a debugging session, view all breakpoints using the different icons.
13. Repeat the same exercises using Visual Studio Code. Note that you do not have to create a project in VS Code.

#### Submission

1. 1-minute screen recording clip to present how you work on your computer to debug a program in Pycharm or VScode.
2. In a text file briefly explain your findings on ```ex01.py, ex02.py, ex03.py``` .
