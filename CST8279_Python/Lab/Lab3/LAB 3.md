   * The annual TFSA dollar limit for the years **2013** and **2014** was **$5,500**.

   * The annual TFSA dollar limit for the year **2015** was **$10,000**.

   * The annual TFSA dollar limit for the year **2016** to **2018** was **$5,500**.

   * The annual TFSA dollar limit for the years **2019 to 2022** is **$6,000**. 

Example output: `You were born in 2000, you turned 18 in 2018, your total contribution limit is` $29500.
