We deal with good quality japanese old furniture which is repaired by us.Our belief is that we offer the greatest quality of products to our customers, help our customers to use these products as long as possible.When we select the products, we think about the history that it has, where and when it is made, who used it. After these research and repair by our craftsmen, these are ready to show you.It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads.
