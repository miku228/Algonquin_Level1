        <p>Growing up, Sir Tim was interested in trains and had a model railway in his bedroom. He recalls:

            “I made some electronic gadgets to control the trains. Then I ended up getting more interested in electronics than trains. Later on, when I was in college I made a computer out of an old television set.”</p>
